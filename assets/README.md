# Tabletop Club Asset Packs

## What is this folder for?

One of the really cool things about Tabletop Club is that you can create,
modify, and add your own (or someone else's) assets in the game using your
favourite image editing / 3D modelling / text editing software, just by putting
them in this folder!

## How do I install asset packs?

All you need to do is drag the asset pack into this folder! Then, when you next
play Tabletop Club, the game should automatically detect the new assets and
import them so you can use them in-game!

## How can I make my own asset pack?

For information and tutorials as to how you can make your own assets for
Tabletop Club, have a look at the
[documentation](https://tabletop-club.readthedocs.io/en/stable/custom_assets/asset_packs/index.html).
