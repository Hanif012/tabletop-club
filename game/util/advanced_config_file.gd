## A version of the in-built [ConfigFile] class with extra features.

## wildcards.


## Similar to [method ConfigFile.get_value], except it checks to see if the
## value is the same data type as [code]default[/code]. Integers will be
## converted to floats if necessary, but the reverse is not true.
