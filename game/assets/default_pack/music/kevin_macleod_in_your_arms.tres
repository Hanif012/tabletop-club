desc = "A piece of music from a more elegant time, 1940. This is a beautiful slow piece that will make you want to pick up some champagne and go off slow dancing with people... or penguins. I like penguins. And now some searchable words: Big Band. 1940s. Forties. Formal Party. Penguin Slow Dance. No Whammies."
