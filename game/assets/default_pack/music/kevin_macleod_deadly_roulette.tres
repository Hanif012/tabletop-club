desc = "Jazzy! Gumshoe-y! Mystery-y! I suck at making adjectives. Who needs adjectives anyway! I'm fine without adjectives. How fine without adjectives, you may ask? I can't say - as that would require some sort of descriptor! And I don't need descriptors in my writings... Maybe one... tiny little... NO! What am I thinking!? I refuse! I've completely had it with adjectives! Hah! Adverbs work perfectly fine! Woohoo! Adverbs! And before I get mail... adjectives killed my family, so I can go off on them all I want."
