class_name TransferPlanState
extends TransferPlan

## A [TransferPlan] that is used to transfer a game state.
##
## [b]NOTE:[/b] This sub-class does not overwrite any functions, but it is
## detected by the DataBroadcaster global, which as it is a [Node], will grab
## the state from the Room node for us. The reason we do that is because this
## class inherits [Reference], not [Node].
