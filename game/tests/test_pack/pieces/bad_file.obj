# This file should fail to import.

v Now this is the story all about how,
v My file got flipped-turned upside down,
v And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there,
v I'll tell you how I became the file of a pack called Bel Air.

v In drwhut's project, born and raised,
v On the hard disk is where I spent most of my days,
v Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool,
v And all triggerin' some interrupts from the memory pool.

vt When a couple of viruses who were up to no good,
vt Started makin' trouble in my system root,
vt I got in one little fight and my filesystem got scared,
vt And said "You're movin' with your objects and textures to Bel Air".

vn I whistled for a serial bus, and when it came near,
vn The ID said "M.1" and it had solid state in the mirror.
vn If anything I could say that this bus was rare,
vn But I thought "Nah forget it, yo home to Bel Air".

f I pulled up to the drive about seven or eight,
f And I yelled to the bus driver "Yo homes, configure ya later".
f Looked at my folder, I was finally there,
f To sit on my throne in the pack called Bel Air.
