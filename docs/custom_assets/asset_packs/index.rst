Asset packs
***********

To make the management and sharing of custom assets easier, assets are put into
what are called **asset packs**, which are essentially just specially-made
folders. This chapter describes the specification for the custom assets, and
the asset packs that contain them.

If you just want to download community-made asset packs and install them, feel
free to have a look at the `official forum <https://forum.tabletopclub.net/c/asset-packs>`_.
Instructions for installing asset packs can be found
`here <https://forum.tabletopclub.net/t/about-the-asset-packs-category/13>`_.

For reference, you can have a look at the Tabletop Club asset pack, which comes
with the game by default.

For easy-to-follow tutorials on how to make assets and asset packs, see
